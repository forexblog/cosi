2019-04-15
==========
Show the field vat_id in the "Accounting" Panel for partner and company.

2019-04-11
==========
Add a new 'partner_ref' field for  :class:`lino.modlib.contacts.Company` to 
store how this partner refers to us. And add this field to the "Accounting"
Panel.

Released Lino Cosi 19.4.0 to PyPI.

2019-03-19
==========
Released Lino Cosi 19.3.0 to PyPI.

2019-03-17
==========

A :ref:`cosi` application no longer has a default VAT declaration plugin.  To
get VAT declarations, you must add something like the following to your local
:xfile:`settings.py` file::

    def get_installed_apps(self):
        yield super(Site, self).get_installed_apps()
        yield 'lino_xl.lib.eevat'

The :mod:`lino_book.projects.pierre` project now has no VAT declarations at
all. :mod:`lino_book.projects.apc` has standard Belgian and
:mod:`lino_book.projects.cosi_ee` standard Estonian declarations. Simplified
Belgian VAT declarations is in :mod:`lino_book.projects.lydia` demo project.


2019-03-16
==========

The :attr:`vat_regime` field was missing in the detail layout of persons and
organizations.

2019-02-12 (v 19.2.0)
=====================

We released :doc:`19.2.0`.

2019-01-21
==========

Products now inherit from :class:`lino.mixins.refs.Referrable`. Because at
least previous TIM users want a :attr:`ref` field per product.  And I imagine
that other users might do so as well.  The field is not yet visible in the
detail view.
